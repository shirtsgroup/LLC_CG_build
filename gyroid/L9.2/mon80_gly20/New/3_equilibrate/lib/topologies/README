I copied itw_v18.itp to ITW.itp and made necessary changes to reflect the new bead types and two added beads at the end

Some changes necessary in ITW_V18.itp

* replace [ atoms ] field of ITW.itp with that of ITW_old.itp
* add space after [
* Add annotation
* Add a colummn with mass
* add [ pair ] field (blank)
* add  ; propers after [ dihedrals ]
* add blank [ dihedrals ] ; impropers
